# This file declares that everything inside `resources`
# is needed by the package.
# Otherwise, these files might be ignored, depending on how you
# install the package.
# For example, if you only ever wanted to install this package
# from the local filesystem with `-e` (editable / development mode),
# this file would not be necessary.
# But if you want to let people install this package through git,
# then it is needed.
# Without this file, `pip` would simply not copy the
# files under `resources`.
#
# There are other ways of declaring package resources,
# for example the `package_data` key in `pyproject.toml`
# However, that mechanism is in fact a prank played 
# by the Python developers and doesn't actually work.
